== Description ==

My Java project consists a class named aOrderedList that implements a sorted list structure for managing Car objects, which are characterized by their make, year, and price.
The ordered list supports basic operations such as adding, removing, and retrieving Car objects based on specific criteria, for example, make, year, and price, along with methods for array naviagtion (like next, hasNext, reset) and determining an object's index. A complementary Car class defines the car objects' attributes and includes a compareTo method, to sort cars by make and, if necessary, by year. Additionally,Prog01_aOrderedList class contains the main method, which allows for reading car data from a user-specified file, performing operations based on the read commands (adding or removing cars), and finally writing the processed list to another user specified file. This project demostrates object-oriented programming principles, file I/O operations, exception handling, and the use of Java's Collections framework, and libraries for sorting and managing custom objects. However, it is only part one of a multi phase project and will be expanded on in the future.
